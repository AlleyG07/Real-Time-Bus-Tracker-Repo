# Track that Bus!
<h4>Shuttle Bus Trail<h4>
  
Description: This tracking project should display a marker moving from the initial starting location of the shuttle bus from MIT to the ending point of the concluding point at Harvard.

How to Run:There are starter files that include an index.html, mapanimation.js and styles.css files. You will first create an access token from mapboxgl and then use it to generate a marker. The marker will start at the beginning of the bus route from MIT and stop at all the stops in between until it reaches its final destination at Harvard and then it will restart the route again.
  
Roadmap of Future Improvements: This project was a success and for that reason I would like to build on it. I would like to track more than one bus and maybe add a route to the current route. The new route would include an express route that goes straight from MIT non stop and another route that is extended to the out skirts of both institutions. I will color code the different markers so that you would be able to identify each route.
